## Executive Summary
The conversion rate of users who choose to signup to this company for a purchase has been low; with approximately 70% of users choosing not to make a purchase, my goal became finding out potential problems in the user experience and offer potential solutions. Using SQL, Tableau, and , I created SQL queries to obtain useful metrics about the user journey through our platform while also using SQL queries fed into Tableau to to identify key characteristics about user spending habits. Having tested the user experience, I suggest the following recommedations to improve the conversion rate and profitability:



## Project Background

## Methods
A majority of the analysis performed during the course of this assignment was primarily conducted on MySQL. Upon the primary inspection of the provided data, it became apparent that a significant amount of users displayed one or both of the following traits: there existed users who chose not to create an account, but used our services to purchase an item, and there were users who chose to give reviews to items before they had arrived; in the former case, users who used our services but decided not to create an account were given a temporary user identification that stores purchase information to allow the user the opportunity to streamline the process of account creation should they choose to create an account in the future. The latter of these issues is problematic as reviews can impact the impression on users browsing the item, and change its purchase rate; as such, a SQL query using CASE statement was created to flag users reviewing products before obtaining them.
